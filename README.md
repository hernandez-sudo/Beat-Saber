# Beat-Saber-Recreation
This is my senior project that I worked with Marley Hernandez. Marley worked on research and I worked on the coding portion of this project.
This is a recreation of the VR game "BEAT SABER". It is also my first time using Unity and coding in C#.
Instead of it being a VR game, it is for the keyboard and a game for 2 people. 

The concept of the game is to hit the incoming cubes with the correct color saber. So if a blue cube is coming, you would hit it with a blue saber. Everytime you hit the cube correctly, your score increases by 2 points. BUT if you hit the wrong color cube, you will LOSE 2 points. 

CONTROLS:
- RED saber is controlled with WASD
- BLUE saber is controlled with ARROW KEYS
- If you need to reset the position of the sabers back to its original spot, press "r" and continue playing.
